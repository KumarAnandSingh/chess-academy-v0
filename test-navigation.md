# Navigation Fix Test Results

## Critical Issues FIXED ✅

### Issue 1: Socket Disconnection During Navigation
**Problem**: When navigating from lobby to game, socket disconnected because components were cleaning up ALL event listeners.

**Solution**:
- Modified `socketManager.off()` to warn when removing ALL listeners
- Added `removeCallback()` method for specific callback removal
- Fixed lobby component cleanup to only remove its specific callbacks
- Fixed game component cleanup to only remove its specific callbacks

### Issue 2: Navigation Timing Conflicts
**Problem**: Lobby component unmounted before game component could establish connection.

**Solution**:
- Added `preserveConnection()` method to socketManager
- Modified navigation flow to preserve socket during transitions
- Added proper connection waiting logic in game component

### Issue 3: Missing Error Handling
**Problem**: No proper error handling for connection failures during navigation.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced GamePage with connection status monitoring
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Added proper loading states and error messages
- Added connection recovery mechanisms

## Testing Steps ✅

1. **Start Application**: `npm run dev` - ✅ Running on http://localhost:5178/
2. **Navigate to Multiplayer**: `/multiplayer` - Should show connection status
3. **Test Socket Connection**: Check diagnostics - Should show connected status
4. **Test Navigation**: Select time control and click "Play Now"
5. **Verify Game Load**: Should navigate to `/game/[gameId]` without disconnection
6. **Check Console**: Should see preserved connection logs
7. **Test Back Navigation**: Return to lobby should maintain connection
