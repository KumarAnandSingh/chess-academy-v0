# üîß Socket Connection Fix - Complete Resolution

## Problem Identified
The frontend was still connecting to the old URL `https://backend-coral-kappa-57.vercel.app` despite environment variable changes due to:

1. **Build-time environment variable binding issues** - Vite wasn't properly embedding the environment variables during production builds
2. **Missing Vercel environment variables** - Production deployments weren't using the correct environment variables
3. **Cached builds** - Old builds contained the hardcoded incorrect URL

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- Added explicit environment variable loading using `loadEnv()`
- Used `define` to embed environment variables at build time
- Added fallback URL to ensure production always has the correct backend URL

### 2. Environment Variable Hierarchy
- Created `.env.local` (highest priority for local development)
- Updated `.env.production` (for production builds)
- Added Vercel environment variable (for cloud deployment)
- All now point to: `https://minimal-socket-server.vercel.app`

### 3. Cache Clearing
- Removed `dist/` build cache
- Removed `.vercel/` deployment cache
- Removed Vite cache (`node_modules/.vite`)
- Fresh production build generated

### 4. Production Deployment
- Deployed new build to Vercel with correct environment variables
- Verified correct URL is embedded in production JavaScript bundle
- New production URL: `https://chess-academy-fm59c2iik-kumaranandsinghs-projects.vercel.app`

## üß™ Testing

### Socket Connection Test
A test file was created (`socket-test.html`) that successfully connects to the correct backend URL.

### Production Verification
The production build now contains the correct URL: `https://minimal-socket-server.vercel.app`

## üöÄ Final Steps for User

1. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) for hard refresh
   - Or open DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Site Data

2. **Test the Production App**:
   - Go to: `https://chess-academy-fm59c2iik-kumaranandsinghs-projects.vercel.app`
   - Open Developer Tools ‚Üí Console
   - Look for connection logs - should show connecting to `minimal-socket-server.vercel.app`
   - Should NOT see any references to `backend-coral-kappa-57.vercel.app`

3. **Verify Socket Connection**:
   - Navigate to the Multiplayer section
   - The connection status should show as connected
   - No more 500 errors in the Network tab

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- Console logs showing: "Connecting to: https://minimal-socket-server.vercel.app"
- No 500 errors in Network tab
- Socket.io connection successful
- Multiplayer functionality working

### ‚ùå If Issues Persist:
- Check browser cache is fully cleared
- Verify you're accessing the latest deployment URL
- Check Network tab for any remaining old URL requests

## Files Modified:
- `/Users/priyasingh/chess-academy/vite.config.ts` - Enhanced environment variable handling
- `/Users/priyasingh/chess-academy/.env.local` - Local environment override
- Vercel environment variables - Added production variable
- Fresh production deployment with cleared caches

The socket connection should now work correctly with the new backend URL!
